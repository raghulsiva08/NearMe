           The Annamalaiyar Temple is one of the largest and most sacred temples in South India. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva, worshipped here as Arunachaleswarar. This temple is one of the Pancha Bhoota Sthalams, representing the element fire (Agni).The temple is located at the base of the Arunachala Hill, and it is famous for the Girivalam (circumambulation) that devotees do around the hill, especially during full moon nights. The temple complex is massive, with beautiful gopurams (towers), large tanks, and ancient sculptures.During the Karthigai Deepam festival, a huge flame is lit on the top of the hill, symbolizing Lord Shiva’s fire form, and it attracts lakhs of devotees. It is not just a religious site but a place full of divine energy and peace.
