            Tiruvannamalai is a sacred town in Tamil Nadu, renowned for its spiritual energy and ancient traditions.
            At the heart of the town lies the majestic Arunachaleswarar Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, one of the largest temples in India.
            Every full moon, thousands of devotees participate in the *Girivalam*—a sacred 14 km walk around the Arunachala Hill.
            The town is steeped in history, home to mystics like Sri Ramana Maharshi. With its serene landscapes, vibrant festivals, and divine ambiance,
            Tiruvannamalai is not just my hometown—it's a spiritual sanctuary.
